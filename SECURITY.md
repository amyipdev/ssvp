# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

You can report security vulnerabilities in the _most recent patch level_ of any SSVP version.

For instance, if v0.1.2 and v0.2.1 exist, and they are the highest _patch levels_, you can report for them; however, you could not report for v0.2.0 or for v0.1.1.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the vulnerability is extremely minor (unlikely to actually affect anyone), you can file an [Issue](https://github.com/amyipdev/ssvp/issues).

If it's a moderate vulnerability (could potentially affect people, but absolute secrecy isn't required), [send an email to Amy](mailto:amy@amyip.net).

If the vulnerability is critical, still send an email, but make sure it's 
[GPG/PGP encrypted](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-gpg-to-encrypt-and-sign-messages). 
Amy's PGP fingerprint is `7786034BD52149F51B0A2A14B1122F04E962DDC5` (expires 2025 July 19), and her keys are available from [`keys.openpgp.org`](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=7786034BD52149F51B0A2A14B1122F04E962DDC5).
