Please note that it is recommended to use RSS over Atom.

RSS
---

You can subscribe to an SSVP's server RSS feed by either:

1. Import the feed directly (add the following link to your reader):

  .. code-block::
  
    (protocol)://(server)/feed.rss
    
2. Click Subscribe -> RSS on an SSVP instance's navbar.

Atom
----

NOTE: Due to lack of compliance with Atom standards and the varying
implementations of the standard, Atom often does not work as intended.
If you're having issues using Atom, please switch to RSS.

The instructions for using Atom are the same as for RSS, with the
exception that you import Atom from the navbar or use the :code:`feed.atom` file.
