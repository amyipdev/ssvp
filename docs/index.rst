SSVP: The Server Statistics Viewer Project
==========================================

SSVP is a utility for viewing statistics and information about your servers, services, and more. It's designed to be a public front page for uptime information,
helping your users know whether issues are coming from your side or theirs.

If you're looking to help build the future of SSVP, go to the `contributor's guide <contributing.html>`_.
If you're just trying to get SSVP set up, go to the `installation guide <installing.html>`_.
